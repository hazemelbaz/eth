Objectives
---
- Describe and explain
  - wireless technology
  - wireless networking standards
  - the process of authentication
  - wardriving
  - wireless hacking
- Explore and exploit tools used by hackers and security professionals


Wireless Technology
---
- A wireless network functions with the right hardware and software
- Wireless technology is part of our lives
  - Baby monitors
  - Keyless entry systems
  - Cellphones and smartphones
  - GPS
  - Remote controls
  - Garage door openers
  - Two-way radios
  - Bluetooth speakers


Wireless Network Components
---
- Access Point (AP)
  - connects to  the wired network with an Ethernet cable
  - Not all wireless networks connect to a wired network
    - Starlink
  - Most companies have Wireless LANs (WLANs) that connect to their wired network topology
- Wireless network interface card (WNIC)


Access Point (AP)
---
- has channels configured 
- enables users to connect to a WLAN using wireless technology
- available only within a defined area
- A wireless router includes an access point, a router, and a switch

Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs)
---
- Name used to identify the wireless local area network (WLAN)
- The SSID is configured on the AP
  - Unique 1- to 32-character alphanumeric name
  - Name is case sensitive
- Wireless computers need to configure the SSID before connecting to a wireless network
- transmitted with each packet
  - Identifies which network the packet belongs
- The AP usually broadcasts the SSID
- Many vendors have SSIDs set to a default value that companies never change
- An AP can be configured to not broadcast its SSID until after authentication
  - Wireless hackers can attempt to guess the SSID
- Verify that your clients or customers are not using a default SSID


Practice ‚úèÔ∏è
---
- Find default SSIDs for popular routers
  - D-Link
  - Netgear
  - Belkin
  - Cisco
  - Compaq


Configuring an Access Point
---
- Most devices allow access through any Web browser
- Enter IP address on your Web browser
  - login with your user logon name and password
  - default or initial logon name and password are printed on the back of AP device


Configuring an Access Point
---
- Change the default SSID
  - Turn off SSID broadcast
- Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption
- WPA (WiFi Protected Access ) is better


Wireless NICs
---
- used to connect to WiFi by each node or computer
- Convert the radio waves to/from digital signals
- Choose a NIC for your purpose
  - Some tools require certain specific brands of NICs
    - Cracking WEP requires NICs with monitor mode or 
    - ability to inject packets


Wireless Network Standards
---
- a set of rules formulated by an organization
- Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
  - Defines several standards for wireless networks


IEEE Standards
---
- pass through these groups:
  - Working group (WG)
  - Sponsor Executive Committee (SEC)
  - Standards Review Committee (RevCom)
  - IEEE Standards Board
- IEEE Project 802
  - LAN and WAN standards


[The 802.11 Standard]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11))
---
- The first wireless technology standard
- Defined wireless connectivity at 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps within a LAN
- Applied to layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model
- Wireless networks cannot detect collisions
  - Carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is used instead of CSMA/CD


Wireless LANs Addressing
---
- not associated with a physical location
- An addressable unit is called a station (STA)


The Basic Architecture of 802.11
---
- uses a basic service set (BSS) as its building block
- nodes within a BSS can communicate with each other
- requires a distribution system (DS) to connect two BSSs


[Frequency Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009)
---
- In the United States, Wi-Fi uses frequencies near 2.4 GHz
  - (Except 802.11a at 5 GHz)
- There are 11 channels, 
  - but they overlap 
  - only three are commonly used


Infrared (IR)
---
- Infrared light can‚Äôt be seen by the human eye
- IR technology is restricted to a single room or line of sight
- IR light cannot penetrate walls, ceilings, or floors


Reading ‚úèÔ∏è
---
- Explore [IEEE Additional 802.11 Projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11)
- Explore [IEEE 802.15 standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15)


[Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth)
---
- Defines a method for interconnecting portable devices without wires
- Maximum distance allowed is 10 meters
- It uses the 2.45 GHz frequency band
- Throughput of up to 2.1 Mbps for Bluetooth 2.0
  - Up to 24 Mbps for Bluetooth 3.0

Wireless network authentication
---
- Establishes that a user is authentic‚Äîauthorized to use the network
- If authentication fails, anyone in radio range can use your network
- The 802.1X Standard
  - Defines the process of authenticating and authorizing users on a WLAN
    - Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
    - Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    - Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
    - Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)


Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
---
- Many ISPs use PPP to connect dial-up or DSL users
- PPP handles authentication with a user name and password
  - sent with PAP or CHAP
  - PAP (Password Authentication Protocol) sends passwords unencrypted
    - Vulnerable to trivial sniffing attacks


CHAP (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol) Vulnerability
---
- Server sends a Challenge with a random value
- Client sends a Response, hashing the random value with the secret password


Practice üìù
---
- [Assless-Chaps : Crack MSCHAPv2 Challenge/Responses Quickly Using A Database Of NT Hashes](https://kalilinuxtutorials.com/assless-chaps/)


Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
---
- an enhancement to PPP
- Allows a company to select its authentication method
  - Certificates
  - Kerberos
    - used on LANs for authentication
    - Uses Tickets and Keys
    - Used by Windows 2000, XP, and 2003 Server by default
    - Not common on WLANS




X.509 Certificate
---
- Record that authenticates network entities
- Identifies
  - The owner
  - The certificate authority (CA)
  - The owner‚Äôs public key
    - used to encrypt data


Practice üìù
---
- Explore certificates 
  - downloaded when browsing a HTTPS website
    - click the padlock icon at the left of the URL address box
  - installed in Chrome browser or Firefox browser


Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP)
---
- A vulnerable Cisco product
- Joshua Wright wrote the [ASLEAP hacking tool to crack LEAP](https://github.com/joswr1ght/asleap)
